# manicure-for-chidi

I am absolutely paralyzed by decision-making.

No, seriously, I once spent an hour in Target choosing two pillows for a couch.  I enjoy small decisions--but they take me a while sometimes.

So, I built this project to decide what kind of manicure I should do.  It's very specific to me, because I hard-coded in all the options I own, but it can be adapted to any collection of nail polish and decorative bits and bobs.

Tis a work in progress, and I can't imagine this being useful to anyone except me.  But it was pretty fun to build.  :)
